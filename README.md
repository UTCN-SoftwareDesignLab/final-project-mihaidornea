Project Description:

The project consists of two applications: 
  - a server which will communicate with the database
  - a client that will be able to send messages to other clients through the server using WebSockets 
    and store the messages in the DB in order to have 'history'. 
    
One client will be able to see only clients that are nearby him/her by using the Google Maps Api.

Further information will be added.
